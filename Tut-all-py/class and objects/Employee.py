Instead of using the normal statements to access attributes, you can use the following functions âˆ’

The getattr(obj, name[, default]) : to access the attribute of object.

The hasattr(obj,name) : to check if an attribute exists or not.

The setattr(obj,name,value) : to set an attribute. If attribute does not exist, then it would be created.

The delattr(obj, name) : to delete an attribute.
